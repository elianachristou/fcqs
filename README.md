## Overview

fquantdr is a package that takes discrete numerical inputs, transform
the data into functional data, and use dimension reduction to reduce the
observations, after which we will apply quantile regression.

## Installation

<!-- You can install the development version of fquantdr from -->
<!-- [GitHub](https://github.com/fquantdr) with: -->

``` r
# To install the package 
install.packages("fquantdr")

# To install development version from Github
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("elianachristou/fquantdr")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

``` r
library(fquantdr)
## basic example code
```

<!-- You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this.
&#10;You can also embed plots, for example:
&#10;<img src="man/figures/README-pressure-1.png" width="100%" />
&#10;In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN. -->

## Usage

<!-- Include ADHD applications? -->

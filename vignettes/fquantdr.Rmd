# Getting Started

To get started you need to first install the package using the command
```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("fquantdr")
```

and then use it during any 'R' session by issuing the command
```{r setup}
library(fquantdr)
```

For an overview of the available help files of the package use
```{r, eval = FALSE}
help(package = "fquantdr")
```

The package includes the following functions (update this part later):

To get help on a specific function type 'help(function.name)' or '?function.name' for a convenient shorthand. Try
```{r, eval = FALSE}
help(fcqs)
?cqs
```

For further examples, refer to the coding examples listed in the documentation for each 'fquantdr' function.
